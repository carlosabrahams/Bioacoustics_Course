# SPATIAL DISPLAY OF AUDIO DATA

Audio data can be linked to geographical information, either through embedding geographical data within you audio dataset during recording (i.e. automated georeferencing of individual sound files), or by combining seperate audio and geographical datasets during processing. We'll look at both using Google Earth, R and QGIS.

\newpage

## Displaying an EM Touch session.kml file in Google Earth

Access the provided data file "Session 20160606_214102.kml" (in EMT_Thurmaston zip).  Note the filename has been automatically generated using the recording start date and time. Open this file using Google Earth.

This data is from a bat transect recorded using an EM Touch. This bat detector uses the iPad's GPS chip to record both the transect route and the location of all bat detections. When downloaded from the tablet, the EM Touch provides a kml for the recording session, together with a bundle of corresponding .wav files (the latter has not been provided today).

Once opened you should see a path (line) for the transect route, and a placemark for the location of all bat detections. Each detection placemark has a name matching the corresponding wav file.

You can click on the detection placemarks to get the details on each and use the right-click 'Get Info' to check the length of the transect.


## Displaying an EM Touch .csv file in R

We'll use some R packages to display some more data for the same site. This data was downloaded from the EM Touch and the automatic identification were manually confirmed - so it has a 'MANUAL' column, as well as the automated species name. 

The packages we'll be using may need installing into R, as they are not part of the basic installation. If you don't have them installed already, then run the following lines, after removing the #.
\newline


```{r install packages}
#Install packages

#The commands below are commented out, using the hashtag, as we don't want these to run everytime

#install.packages("tidyverse")

#install.packages("ggmap")

```


Now we can clear memory, activate the packages using the 'library' command, and use the following code to load and view the .csv with the transect data.
\newline

```{r Start packages, echo=T, results='hide'}

#Clear memory
rm(list=ls())

#Activate the ggmap package for this session using the 'library' command
library(ggmap)

#Activate the tidyverse package
library(tidyverse)

```



```{R Load transect csv}

#Load the .csv data
#Find the file named gpsthurm16.csv you have been provided with
#gpsdata <- read_csv(file.choose())

#To make your script reproducible, it would be better to use the actual filepath instead, as below
gpsdata <- read_csv("Data/EMtouch Thurmaston/gpsthurm16.csv")

#Take a look at your data to check its structure using glimpse
glimpse(gpsdata)

#You can also use summary to take a different sort of look
summary(gpsdata)

#Check what species have been manually confirmed using unique command
unique(gpsdata$MANUAL)

```


You'll note that there are 1638 wav files listed, but many of these are 'noise' and 'NoID' detections.  We don't want these, so will filter then out from the dataset.  This will reduce the number of rows in the .csv to 287.
\newline

```{r filter noise}

#Filter to remove noise and noID files
gpsdata <- filter(gpsdata, MANUAL != "NOISE" & MANUAL != "NoID")

#Check which species remain
unique(gpsdata$MANUAL)

```


The dataset has now been wrangled into shape, leaving only the species registrations we are after.  Let's map these using ggmap.  First we'll download a basemap from the internet (or upload from our computers, if we don't have access) - and plot this.
\newline

```{r get a basemap}

#Download a base map, using lat and long coordinates for the site 
#Zoom level goes from 3 to 20, 3 being continent level, 10 being city-scale, 20 being single building


basemap <- get_stamenmap(bbox = c(left = -1.08, bottom = 52.655, right = -1.058, top = 52.675), zoom = 14)

#Sometimes this can be slow to load, so you may want to save the ggmap object and then load the file instead
# save(basemap, file = "mybasemap.RData")
# load(file = "mybasemap.RData")

# Display the basemap
# This will appear in the Plots window if in a basic script, or below this chunk in Markdown 
ggmap(basemap)


```


Then we'll add all of the bat detection registrations, using a colour for each species.


```{r draw dot map}
#Draw dot plan for each detection
ggmap(basemap) +
  geom_point(aes(x= LONG, y= LATITUDE, colour = MANUAL), data = gpsdata)


```


Now that we have the points plotted, we'll develop this further, with a heatmap. This calculates and draws a density plot over the baseplan, to give a contour map indicating bat activity levels.
\newline

```{r heatmap}

#Plot a density heatmap with data points overlaid
ggmap(basemap) + 
  stat_density2d(data = gpsdata, 
                 aes(x = LONG, y = LATITUDE),  alpha = 0.1,
                 bins = 10, geom = "polygon")  +
  geom_point(data = gpsdata, aes(x = LONG, y = LATITUDE, colour = MANUAL), size = 0.3)


```


That's a useful figure, but a bit confusing with eight species shown - some of which have widely differing habitat preferences.  It would be good to see a heatmap like this for each species - using a 'facet' plot.  We'll also add a title.
\newline

```{r facet heatmap}

#Plot the same density heatmap as before
ggmap(basemap) + 
  stat_density2d(data = gpsdata, 
                 aes(x = LONG, y = LATITUDE), alpha = 0.1,  
                 bins = 5, geom = "polygon")  +
  geom_point(data = gpsdata, aes(x = LONG, y = LATITUDE), size = 0.5) +
#But this time we'll 'facet' by species (using the MANUAL column)
  facet_wrap(~ MANUAL, ncol = 4) +
#And add a title
  ggtitle("Bat species distribution")

```
