##Course Overview

This course will introduce and explain the different applications for  bioacoustics to answer ecological questions. 

Starting with an  overview of methods of data collecting in the field, this course will then go on to show delegates  methods for analysing and interpreting different types of bioacoustic data.

By the end of the course, attendees will have the capacity to set up and deploy recording devices, download acoustic data,  know how to analyse this data and report the results.

Bioacoustic methods are becoming increasingly recognised as a valuable approach for ecological surveying. Bioacoustics can be used to effectively replace some current techniques whilst increasing the quality of the data collected or used in unison to compliment them. They are particularly useful for developing long-term, permanent datasets that can be independently reviewed, particularly for rare species with low detectability, or when working in difficult environments.

The course will provide a practical introduction to bioacoustics methods, with a mix of lectures and practical workshops, and some optional fieldwork. It will start with a basic introduction to sound and recording theory, before developing hands-on skills in setting-up and deploying a range of acoustic and ultrasonic audio recorders. 

Workshops will then cover the download and analysis of audio data, using R, Kaleidoscope Pro and Audacity software. 

Example data sets will mostly cover applications for bat and bird surveys, as well as the use of Acoustic Indices as biodiversity metrics. 

**Intended Audience**

This course is suitable for anyone working with bioacoustics from those  in academia, conservation biology and monitoring and persons in industry and government.
