# Pre-Course Software Instructions

Welcome to the bioacoustics course taking place next week.  The tutors for the course will be myself, Carlos Abrahams from Baker Consultants (and Nottingham Trent University), and Paul Howden-Leach from Wildlife Acoustics.
 
To get prepared for the activities on the course, it would be great if you could ensure that you have the necessary software installed and ready to go on your computers.  We’ll be using three pieces of software:
 
**R and RStudio**.  I’m hoping/assuming that everyone attending will have at least some experience using R and RStudio, and doesn’t need assistance in downloading and installing this software.  We will be using the following packages, so if you could install (or update) these prior to the course, that would be great: `tidyverse, ggmap, seewave, tuner, lubridate`.  Please note, though, that we won’t be using R on the first day, so if you run into problems, please let me know then, and we can try and sort them out.
 
**Audacity**. This is a free and open-source sound file editor, commonly used for displaying and editing bioacoustic recordings.  Please download and install it from: https://www.audacityteam.org/
 
**Kaleidoscope Pro**. This commercial software is widely used for analysing bat call data, and increasingly for clustering sound files and calculating acoustic indices. It requires a paid subscription for full functionality, but has a free version that is still very useful for (very rapidly) displaying and analysing sound files.  You can download and install from here: https://www.wildlifeacoustics.com/products/kaleidoscope/kaleidoscope-lite. 
You will need to create an account in order to download and install – and should get a two week free trial to the full paid version. If there are any issues with the latter, we can provide a full licence key on Tuesday as needed to provide full access.
 
Lastly, I will be hosting the course on Github to allow you to download the necessary data files, handouts and presentations for the course activities– so it may be worth bookmarking the following location in your browser: https://github.com/carlosabrahams/Bioacoustic_Course
